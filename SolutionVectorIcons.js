The solution involves using `expo prebuild` to ensure that native modules are properly linked.  Additionally, make sure that your `ios` and `android` directories are set up correctly.  If issues persist, you might need to eject and manually link native libraries.   For a more concise solution, check your `app.json` for `expo-cli` and ensure you are using a recent version. Then, run the prebuild step again: `expo prebuild`. If that doesn't work, consider cleaning the project's cache before rebuilding.  Always review the Expo documentation and community forums for the most up-to-date instructions related to linking native modules in Expo.
