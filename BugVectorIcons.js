This error typically occurs when using Expo's `@expo/vector-icons` package and you have not correctly linked the necessary native modules for the icons in your iOS or Android project.  The issue might manifest in different ways, like missing icons or build failures.  The error message may not explicitly point to this problem. The root cause often lies in inconsistencies between the installation of the package and the configuration of your native projects.
